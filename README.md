# Smart Bathroom
### Internet of Things project: Smart Bathroom by Maria Laura Bisogno, Luca Coppola, Vincenzo Longobardi

The idea was to create a model of a bathroom including a shower, a heating system and a lamp to simulate a real smart bathroom that can be simply controlled by mobile app.

With the application is possible to: 
- check the temperature of the room
- switch on/off every component of the bathroom
- set the 'shower time' and the desired temperature: 'shower time' means that if the user plan to do a shower at 8pm, it will set the shower time at 8 o'clock. If the interval between the set time and the shower time at the moment of the setting is less than 30 minutes, and the temperature of the room is lower than the desired one, the heating system will be immediately swiched on until the room will be warm enough; if the interval is more than 30 minutes, it will switch on the heating system 30 minutes before the shower time.

We used the NUCLEO-F401RE STM32 microcontroller, the X-NUCLEO-IDW01M1 Wi-Fi module and X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 environmental sensor expansion board.
To simulate the shower, we used a submersible pump that works with 220V.
Since the nucleo f401re can output a maximum of 5V we used an external power supply (12V) to trigger the 12V relay and a transistor connected in this way:

The same circuit is used to control the heating system, simulated with a state led and two 12KÎ© ceramic resistors in parallel. Both will be activated only if the temperature is lower than the desired one.
To simulate the lamp we used a led, controlled through MPS2 222A transistor, that will be switched on only if the light in the room is not enough.
